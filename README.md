# Information:
SunRays is a mobile application that estimates the electricity production of a photovoltaic system based on a few simple inputs. SunRays calculates estimated values for the system's current, daily, monthly and annual electricity production taking in mind the sun's position and the weather conditions. To assist the precision of the calculation, SunRays uses a number of different data sources, including geolocation, solar position and irradiation data, and weather services.

By marking your position on the map and adding your photovoltaic modules to the list, you are giving it all the information it needs to estimate the production of your system. Adding your consumer electronics to the math is also simple. SunRays will show you your estimated usage and production.
